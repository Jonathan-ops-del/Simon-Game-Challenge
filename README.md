# Simon-Game-Challenge

Using jQuery to create the Simon Game Challenge. A Boss Level Challenge presented by Angela Yu - Online Udemy Web Development Course. The Simon Game challenge is a classic game of memory power. The game has 4 different color buttons (namely green, red, yellow, blue) and sounds. The device will automatically start blinking random buttons and play sounds according to those buttons and the user will have to repeat the same sequence in order to advance to the next level. As you advance to the next level, the device challenges your memory skill as you have to remember a long sequence and if you get the order wrong, you have lost the game.
